    xen/kconfig,menuconfig,mconf-cfg: Allow specification of ncurses location

    In some cross build environments such as the Yocto Project build
    environment it provides an ncurses library that is compiled
    differently than the host's version.  This causes display corruption
    problems when the host's curses includes are used instead of the
    includes from the provided compiler are overridden.  There is a second
    case where there is no curses libraries at all on the host system and
    menuconfig will just fail entirely.

    The solution is simply to allow an override variable in
    check-lxdialog.sh for environments such as the Yocto Project.  Adding
    a CROSS_CURSES_LIB and CROSS_CURSES_INC solves the issue and allowing
    compiling and linking against the right headers and libraries.
