Subject: [PATCH 05/34] upstream change to garbage collection sweep causes mb
 regression

Upstream change for PR13177 now clears the def_regular during gc_sweep of a
section. (All other archs in binutils/bfd/elf32-*.c received an update
to a warning about unresolvable relocations - this warning is not present
in binutils/bfd/elf32-microblaze.c, but this warning check would not
prevent the error being seen)

The visible issue with this change is when running a c++ application
in Petalinux which links libstdc++.so for exception handling it segfaults
on execution.

This does not occur if static linking libstdc++.a, so its during the
relocations for a shared lib with garbage collection this occurs

Upstream-Status: Pending
