# meta-xilinx-standalone-experimental

This layer contains experimental items that may eventually be added to the
meta-xilinx-standalone layer.  The components in this layer may or may not be
buildable as they may require unreleased code.

The non-Linux software components are still in development and this should be
considered to be a preview release only.  For instance, some components may not
be buildable, expect APIs to change on various parts and pieces.

## Build Instructions

> **Note:**
> * To use this layer you must REMOVE meta-xilinx-tools from your project.
meta-xilinx-tools is not compatible with this experimental approach. You may
also have to remove other layers that depend on meta-xilinx-tools, such as
meta-kria and meta-system-controller.
> * To use the experimental version of the embedded software (firmware) as well
as system configuration, you must build through gen-machineconf tool. This tool
is passed a output of system device tree directory.

The Yocto Project setup for the System Device Tree (SDT) workflow is as follows.
Be sure to read everything below.

1. Follow [Building Instructions](https://github.com/Xilinx/meta-xilinx/blob/master/README.building.md)
   upto step 4.

2. Remove meta-xilinx-tools and meta-xilinx-tools dependency layers(such as
   meta-kria and meta-system-controller if included in bblayers.conf), then add
   the meta-xilinx-standalone-experimental layer.

> **Note:** SDT builds for following devices are not supported in 2024.1 release.
> * Zynq 7000
> * MicoBlaze
> * Kria
> * System Controller

```
$ bitbake-layers remove-layer meta-xilinx-tools
$ bitbake-layers remove-layer meta-kria
$ bitbake-layers remove-layer meta-system-controller
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ./<path-to-layer>/meta-xilinx/meta-xilinx-standalone-experimental
```

3. Export gen-machineconf tool.
```
$ export PATH=$PATH:<ABSOLUTE_PATH>/gen-machine-conf
```

4. Run the script from the build or ${TOPDIR} directory. This step describes
   System Device Tree (SDT) with and without pl overlays. Configruations are same
   for both SDT with and without pl overlays except for linux dts content.

> **Note:**
> 1. The -l option will automatically add the necessary parameters to the
   local.conf file.  If you need to re-run this comment, you just clear the
   parameters from the end of the file.  Without the -l option the items are
   printed to the screen and must be manually added to your conf/local.conf
> 2. The --soc-family argument is an optional argument and user can skip this.
> 3. By default minimal set of multiconfigs are generated by gen-machineconf tool.
>    To enable full multiconfig(APU/RPU baremetal or FreeRTOS) then use
>    `--multiconfigfull` option.

   a. Without SDT pl overlay:
```
 $ gen-machineconf --hw-description <path_to_sdtgen_output_directory> -c <conf> -l conf/local.conf
```

   b. With SDT pl overlay:
      To generate SDT pl overlay run gen-machineconf command with
      `-g {full|dfx}` option. Once SDT pl overlay command is executed successfully
      pl.dtsi will be generated under <conf>/dts/${MACHINE}/pl-overlay-{full|dfx}
      directory. User can use this pl.dtsi as input to full or dfx static firmware
      recipes.

> **Note:** DFx partial dtsi is not processed by gen-machineconf(lopper) tool, User
>          needs to use the *_partial.dtsi and *_partial.pdi/bit from sdtgen output
>          artifacts to DFx partial firmware recipes.

   * ZynqMP Full bitstream or Versal Segmented Configuration:
```
 $ gen-machineconf parse-sdt --hw-description <path_to_sdtgen_output_directory> -c <conf> -l conf/local.conf -g full
```

   * ZynqMP or Versal DFx:
```
 $ gen-machineconf parse-sdt --hw-description <path_to_sdtgen_output_directory> -c <conf> -l conf/local.conf -g dfx
```

For example, zynqmp:
```
$ gen-machineconf --soc-family zynqmp --hw-description <path_to_sdtgen_output_directory> -c conf/ -l conf/local.conf
```
The following will be written to the end of the conf/local.conf file:

```
# Each multiconfig will define it's own TMPDIR, this is the new default based
# on BASE_TMPDIR for the Linux build
TMPDIR = "${BASE_TMPDIR}/tmp"

# Use the newly generated MACHINE
MACHINE = "xlnx-zynqmp-zcu102-rev1-0"

# All of the TMPDIRs must be in a common parent directory. This is defined
# as BASE_TMPDIR.
# Adjust BASE_TMPDIR if you want to move the tmpdirs elsewhere, such as /tmp
BASE_TMPDIR ?= "${TOPDIR}"

# The following is the full set of multiconfigs for this configuration
# A large list can cause a slow parse.
#BBMULTICONFIG = " cortexa53-0-zynqmp-fsbl-baremetal cortexa53-0-zynqmp-baremetal cortexa53-0-zynqmp-freertos cortexa53-1-zynqmp-baremetal cortexa53-1-zynqmp-freertos cortexa53-2-zynqmp-baremetal cortexa53-2-zynqmp-freertos cortexa53-3-zynqmp-baremetal cortexa53-3-zynqmp-freertos cortexr5-0-zynqmp-fsbl-baremetal cortexr5-0-zynqmp-baremetal cortexr5-0-zynqmp-freertos cortexr5-1-zynqmp-baremetal cortexr5-1-zynqmp-freertos microblaze-0-pmu"
# Alternatively trim the list to the minimum
BBMULTICONFIG = " cortexa53-0-zynqmp-fsbl-baremetal microblaze-0-pmu"
```

For example, versal:
```
$ gen-machineconf --soc-family versal --hw-description <path_to_sdtgen_output_directory> -c conf/ -l conf/local.conf
```

The following will be written to the end of the conf/local.conf file:

```
# Each multiconfig will define it's own TMPDIR, this is the new default based
# on BASE_TMPDIR for the Linux build
TMPDIR = "${BASE_TMPDIR}/tmp"

# Use the newly generated MACHINE
MACHINE = "xlnx-versal-vmk180-rev1-1-x-ebm-01-reva"

# All of the TMPDIRs must be in a common parent directory. This is defined
# as BASE_TMPDIR.
# Adjust BASE_TMPDIR if you want to move the tmpdirs elsewhere, such as /tmp
BASE_TMPDIR ?= "${TOPDIR}"

# The following is the full set of multiconfigs for this configuration
# A large list can cause a slow parse.
#BBMULTICONFIG = " cortexa72-0-versal-baremetal cortexa72-0-versal-freertos cortexa72-1-versal-baremetal cortexa72-1-versal-freertos microblaze-0-pmc microblaze-0-psm cortexr5-0-versal-baremetal cortexr5-0-versal-freertos cortexr5-1-versal-baremetal cortexr5-1-versal-freertos"
# Alternatively trim the list to the minimum
BBMULTICONFIG = " microblaze-0-pmc microblaze-0-psm"
```
> **Bitbake Performance Note:**
Each BBMULTICONFIG value requires all of the recipes to be parsed for that
configuration.  Thus each multiconfig will add more parsing time.  A long list
can lead to a very slow parse (many minutes).  To speed up parsing, it is
suggested that you trim this down to only the configurations you require.
A minimum configuration is included with the generated configuration.


5. Build your project, You should now be able to build your project normally.
   See the Yocto Project documentation if you have questions on how to work with
   the multiconfig recipes. The following is a simple build for testing.

6. Continue [Building Instructions](https://github.com/Xilinx/meta-xilinx/blob/master/README.building.md)
   from step 6.
