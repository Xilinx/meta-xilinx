meta-xilinx
===========

This layer provides Official support for Xilinx MicroBlaze and Zynq
architectures as well as evaluation boards.

Supported Boards/Machines
=========================

Boards Supported by this layer (Please refer to the associate .conf for more
information):
	* Xilinx KC705 Embedded TRD (MicroBlaze)
	* Xilinx ZC702 (Zynq)
	* Avnet/Digilent ZedBoard (Zynq)

Additional information on the MicroBlaze or Zynq architectures can be found at:

Patches
=======

Please submit any patches for this layer to: meta-xilinx@lists.yoctoproject.org.

Please see the MAINTAINERS file for more details.

Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/bitbake

	URI: git://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core
	layers: meta

Build Instructions
==================

The following instructions require a Poky installation (or equivalent).

Initialize a build using the 'oe-init-build-env' script in Poky. Once
initialized configure bblayers.conf by adding the 'meta-xilinx' layer. e.g.:

	BBLAYERS ?= " \
		<path to layer>/oe-core/meta \
		<path to layer>/meta-xilinx \
		"

To build a specific target BSP configure the associated machine in local.conf:

	MACHINE ?= "zc702-zynq7"

Build the target file system image using bitbake:

	$ bitbake core-image-minimal

Build additional targets, including U-Boot:

	$ bitbake u-boot-xlnx

Once complete the images for the target machine will be available in the output
directory 'tmp/deploy/images'.

Images generated:
	* core-image-minimal-<machine name>.tar.gz (rootfs tar+GZIP)
	* core-image-minimal-<machine name>.cpio (rootfs in CPIO format)
	* core-image-minimal-<machine name>.ext2.gz.u-boot (rootfs in EXT2+GZIP, u-boot wrapped format)
	* u-boot.elf (U-Boot ELF)
	* For Zynq:
		* uImage (Linux Kernel binary, in u-boot wrapped format)
		* uImage-<machine name>.dtb (DTB for target machine)
	* For MicroBlaze:
		* linux.bin.ub (Linux Kernel binary, in u-boot wrapped format)
		* linux.bin.ub-<machine name>.dtb (DTB for target machine)

Booting
=======

Please see the associated README file for each avaliable boot method in the
'docs/BOOT.*' files of this layer.

Configuring External Toolchain
==============================

In order to build with an external toolchain some additional configuration must
be set in the build environments local.conf. First configure the use of an
external toolchain, including the location to the toolchain:

	TCMODE = "external-xilinx"
	EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN = "<path to toolchain>"

WARNING: There is a known issue with the MicroBlaze Linux toolchain provided by
XSDK 2013.3 where certain shift instructions are not generated correctly, avoid
using this toolchain. Use the newer XSDK 2013.4 or PetaLinux 2013.10 toolchains.
